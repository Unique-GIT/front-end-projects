# front-end-projects
I'm trying to learn CSS and then moving forward tailwind CSS via these projects . It seems like a pretty useful thing to have , particularly when you want to make a website . One can always import components , but where's the customization in that ! 

The challenges are taken from frontendmentor.io
Look inside individual folders for their READMEs with a short summary of what I learnt via that project !
