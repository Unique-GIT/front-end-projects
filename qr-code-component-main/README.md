## Overview

### Screenshot

This is a cropped screenshot of the component styled 

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

This was a basic learning for grid and flexbox. 
The major challenge for me , was positioning the elements correctly as well figuring out the usage of figma files to get the properties of the components.

### Continued development

I wish to continue refining on dynamic positioning with respect to the window size , that hasn't been good for this project. Also , looking forward to learning more on positioning various elements on the screen via flexbox and grid and their varying usecases.
The main goal is to host a site using React+Tailwind CSS . I also wish to learn a bit more about hosting websites.
